#summary Guide to making a release of Hamcrest

= How to make a Hamcrest release =

Assuming you have the following variables set:

{{{
VERSION=1.0         <-- CHANGE ME
PROJECT=hamcrest-java
SVNROOT=https://hamcrest.googlecode.com/svn
}}}

Note: if using Windows, replace $X with %X% in the scripts below.

You also need to be in the hamcrest-java directory.

== Tag the release in Subversion ==

{{{
svn copy -m "Tagged $VERSION" $SVNROOT/trunk/$PROJECT $SVNROOT/tags/$PROJECT-$VERSION
}}}


== Perform a clean build ==

{{{
svn switch $SVNROOT/tags/$PROJECT-$VERSION
ant -Dversion=$VERSION
}}}

Check that the build was successful!

== Verify the distribution ==

{{{
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
tar -xvzf ../build/hamcrest-$VERSION.tgz
cd hamcrest-$VERSION.tgz
ant
}}}

Check that the build was successful!

== Upload to Google Code ==

The following files should be uploaded from the build directory to Google Code:
{{{
hamcrest-$VERSION.tgz
hamcrest-$VERSION.zip
hamcrest-all-$VERSION.jar
hamcrest-core-$VERSION.jar
hamcrest-library-$VERSION.jar
hamcrest-integration-$VERSION.jar
hamcrest-generator-$VERSION.jar
}}}

== Clean up ==

{{{
cd ../../
rm -rf tmp
rm -rf build
svn switch $SVNROOT/trunk/$PROJECT
}}}

== All done! ==

  # Announce to the world.
  # Go to pub.
