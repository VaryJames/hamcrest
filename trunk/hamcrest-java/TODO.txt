* Add matchers for dealing with collections allowing flexibility over:
  - ordered/not-ordered
  - use of matchers for item checking
  - contains these items, at least
  - contains these items, exclusively
  - contains none of thes items
  - all items should match a specific matcher

* Collection based matchers should not care about implementation of datastructure. Polymorphism across:
  - arrays
  - collections
  - iterators
  - iterables (jdk 1.5)

* String matchers
  - case insensitive
  - whitespace insensitive
  - reg exp matching

* XML
  - is wellformed XML
  - xpath expressions for XML/HTML strings and existing Nodes

* Invocation
  - method called
  - ... with particular arguments

* JDK 1.5 Enums

* Sugar for between(12, 20)

* ComparisonMatcher (See NMock2)

* Sugar for new matchers

* NOT_NULL, IS_ANYTHING, etc -> notNull(), isAnything(), etc.
