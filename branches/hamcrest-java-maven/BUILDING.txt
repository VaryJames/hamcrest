--[ Build requirements ]-------------------------------------

* JDK 1.5
  Note: that this is a buildtime dependency for 1.5 specific
  features. However the final built jars should run on 1.4
  and 1.3 JVMs with some features unavailable.

* Maven 2 or greater


--[ Building from the command line ]-------------------------

Execute the default Maven goal:
  mvn install

This will do a full build, run all tests and install the 
project in the local Maven repository.

<TODO how to build the distributions, including 'all' />

To do a full clean build:
  mvn clean install

<TODO how to do this with maven?>  
The default version number used in the build is 'SNAPSHOT'.
To override this, you can pass a property to ant:
  ant -Dversion=MY.OTHER.VERSION
</TODO>

--[ Building from the IDE ]----------------------------------

It is possible to compile and test the source directly from
popular IDEs, without resorting to the command line.

Steps:
  - Run 'ant library'. This generates additional Java coded
    necessary to compile.
  - Create a new project.
  - Add hamcrest-api/src/main, hamcrest-library/src/main,
    hamcrest-generator/src/main, hamcrest-integration/src/main,
    and build/generated-code as source directories.
  - Add hamcrest-unit-test/src/main as a test directory. If this is
    unsupported by the IDE, add it as another source
    directory.
  - Include all jars in the lib directory in the classpath.
  - Compile as usual in the IDE.
  - If supported, run all tests under org.hamcrest from the
    IDEs JUnit runner.
